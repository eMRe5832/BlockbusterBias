Initial Step
Get predictions for ten algorithms on five datasets via Surprise. (see Predict.py) and save them as "DatasetName-AlgorithmName.txt" in their corresponding folder in the Predictions. Note that in the Datasets folder, we store the datasets as .mat file. ML-100K and ML-1M are stored as user-item matrix.
