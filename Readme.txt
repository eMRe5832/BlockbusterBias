This repository belongs to the paper tittle with "Exploring potential biases towards blockbuster items in ranking-based recommendations" published at "Data Mining and Knowledge Discover" journal of Springer. 


Initial Step
Get predictions for ten algorithms on five datasets via Surprise library in Python (see Predict.py) and save predicted scores as "DatasetName-AlgorithmName.txt" in their corresponding folder in the Predictions file. Note that in the Datasets folder, we store the datasets as .mat file. ML-100K and ML-1M are stored as user-item matrix while other datasets are stored as userID|itemID|Rating as nx3 format.
